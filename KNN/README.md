#### K-NN (K Nearest Neighbor Classification)
- Classification: The purpose of this algorithm is to classify a new object based on attributes and training samples. K Nearest neighbor algorithm used neighborhood classification as the prediction value of the new query instance. 
 1.  The classifiers do not use any model to fit and only based on memory. Given a query point, we find K number of objects or (training points) closest to the query point. 

#### KMEANS (Clustering is a method of vector quantization)
- Image segmentation is the process of partitioning a digital image into multiple segments (sets of pixels). 
- Clustering image elements that “belong together” 
- Grouping: Identify sets of coherent tokens in image 
- The basic step of k-means clustering is simple. In the beginning we determine number of cluster K and we assume the centroid or center of these clusters. We can take any random objects as the initial centroids or the first K objects in sequence can also serve as the initial centroids.
