To summarize this fully implemented program. I first built out a training model in order to properly detect fruit and predict the tested output. I then modified my model in order to gain a high accuracy in testing via data analysis from the accuracy graphs in the loss graphs. I also investigated confusion matrix to see the overall accuracy of how the model predicted certain fruits versus incorrectly predicted results. Once I analyzed these models by then implemented a histogram matching technique that was testing in other programs so that it could be easily implemented within this one. Once I was able to analyze the histogram bins scores for the red, blue, green spectrum I finally was able to threshold the cumulative distribution function two finally make a scoring algorithm for the ripeness verse the rottenness of fruit. 

This is the final output of our program. It predicts with the trained model and then guesses the apple and bananas ripeness. You can see that it has 50% correct predictions, but the other predictions are only one step away from their correct output. This program correctly predicts the raw image 99% of the time and predicts the ripeness of the fruit on a 1:2 bases with a bias of 75:100. The bias comes from predictions of ripeness being within the same neighbors of the wanted output.
